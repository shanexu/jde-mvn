TODOS
--------------------
* Use Nexus in jde-mvn-pom-add-dependency if available

* Allow (interactive) build property specification in jde-mvn-build

* Somehow handle src/test and target/test-classes - difficult!

* Somehow handle test failures

* Would it be nice to have a run-this-class-as-junit-test thingy?

* Maybe distribute maven-v4_0_0.rnc to ease POM file editing?

* Some way of triggering recursive builds (currently all builds are
  non-recursive, but the server allows both)
