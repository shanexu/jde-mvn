To build jde-mvn from source, you need access to maven-embedder
3.0-SNAPSHOT and its dependencies.  It *should* just work to run 'mvn
package'; if not, Sonatype may have moved, deleted or blocked access
to their Maven snapshot repository (or 3.0 may have been released,
stranger things have happened).

mvn package will produce target/jde-mvn-${version}-dist.zip.
